# Dig-Sign Admin Design System

## Register

Product UI for internal broadcast operations. Design serves fast scanning, scheduling confidence, and error correction.

## Source of Truth

Visual brief: `/Users/macarenazalazar/Downloads/rtv-air-manager_2.html`. Token authority: same file, lines `:11-18`.

## Tokens

All tokens declared in `tailwind.config.ts` (P1.1). Component code MUST consume these by name.

| Token                         | Value                   | Usage                                               |

| `accent-live`                 | `#e7000b`               | LIVE / ON AIR pill bg                               |

## Typography

- Family: DM Sans 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 / 800. Loaded via `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Base size: 13px.
- Inline scale used in chyron: 9-15px. Eyebrow at 9px with uppercase and letter-spacing 1.5-2px.

## Radii and Shape

- Square edges.
- Default `--r: 10px` for small radius on cards and buttons.
- `border-radius: 50%` only on dot indicators (live dot, category dot).

## Motion

- `blink` 1.4s -- ON AIR pill, LIVE dot.
- `pd` 2s -- globe / earthcam preview.
- `bar-grow` -- market chart preview.
- All animations gated by `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.

## Layout

- Fixed 56px sidebar.
- Fixed 48px topbar.
- Main content column.
- Optional 240px right-rail operations panel.
- Responsive within main column only. NOT a 1920x1080 fixed canvas (chyron mood-board is the only fixed-canvas surface).

## Chyron-Canonical Brand Green

`#1ae784` (`accent-positive`) is RoxomTV's brand green. Used for positive sentiment, active states, brand accents. Same value and role as the chyron design system documented in `~/.claude/skills/roxom-design-tokens/SKILL.md`.

## Forbidden

- No raw hex or rgba in component code. Tokens only.
- No light theme.
- No imports from `/Users/macarenazalazar/Downloads/x-ready-to-implement` (chyron mood board, separate project).
- No spark-ui, no Yarn, no Inter. RoxomTV ships on npm and DM Sans.

## Out of Scope

- Light/dark toggle.
- Mobile responsive (broadcast operator console is desktop only).
- High-contrast mode.

## Copy

- Admin copy stays short, concrete, and action-oriented.
- Spanish UI text is preferred for operator-facing labels.
- Avoid explaining how the whole product works inside the UI. Each empty state should name the next action.
