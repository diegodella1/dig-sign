# RTV Planner

RTV Planner is the broadcast control room for Roxom TV. It lets an operator plan the day, prepare media, validate schedule risk, run a live checklist, and send a protected browser playout signal into OBS or vMix.

It is not a public video site. It is an internal operator console for keeping a daily TV-style stream organized, auditable and ready to recover.

## Current Status

Production is live at `rtvtime.diegodella.ar` using local standalone Next.js behind a Cloudflare tunnel. The core workflow is ready for controlled operation with an operator present.

What is already working:

- unified operator flow with `/admin/prepare`, `/admin/program` and `/admin/operate`
- daily schedule builder with timed blocks
- timeline-first schedule UI with visible newly-added block confirmation, time ranges and gap filling
- media library for uploads, remote URLs, Vimeo, slides, music and fallbacks
- guest library with per-plate lineups, uploaded/remote guest photos and short muted guest videos
- city-specific weather plates, schedule-only **Fill range with plates** loops, and a unified
  **Fallback policy** for off-air and playback-failure safety
- Supabase database/storage backend, including local-storage media proxy for public playback
- browser playout for OBS/vMix capture
- Vimeo, HLS, MP4, images, slides and Reuters stream snapshots
- real-data slide feeds for metals, weather, market/open boards, debt, guests and calendar events,
  with graceful fallbacks when providers are unavailable
- reload recovery that resumes video near the current scheduled offset
- validated web player capture in browser, vMix and OBS
- uploaded ads/promos served through `/api/media/assets/:assetId` so local Supabase storage stays playable from OBS/vMix and remote browsers
- per-program `PREVIOUSLY RECORDED` on-screen bug with four-corner placement, limited to normal
  video program blocks
- output control, monitor state and live overrides
- runbook for preflight, live notes, incident handling and shutdown
- admin health, schedule health and Go Live Drill
- persisted smoke status from deploy/read-only smoke scripts
- named operators, sessions, role guards, CSRF protection and audit logging
- protected active-block/health operational endpoints, atomic API rate limiting and alert cooldowns
- fresh Supabase bootstrap SQL for moving to a new backend

Main product gate now pending: remodel the visual design of the output plates so the channel looks intentionally produced rather than just operationally correct, then tighten operator alerts for drift, stalls, silence and media errors.

Deployment note: the active production path is still local standalone Next.js behind a Cloudflare tunnel. OpenNext/Cloudflare Workers support is configured and deployable, but should be treated as an alternate path until a real Workers deploy is smoke-tested.

## Product Promise

RTV Planner replaces scattered broadcast prep with one operational flow:

1. Load or sync content.
2. Build the broadcast day.
3. Catch gaps, overlaps and missing fallbacks before air.
4. Complete preflight.
5. Launch browser output.
6. Monitor the current signal.
7. Stop cleanly with an audit trail.

The value is not just playing media. The value is reducing live mistakes: wrong block, missing fallback, expired live URL, unreviewed media, silent output, or unclear operator handoff.

## Main Routes

- `/admin/login` - operator login
- `/admin` - cockpit dashboard
- `/admin/prepare` - unified intake for assets, Vimeo, music, guests and plates
- `/admin/program` - daily programming hub for calendar, schedule, timed loops, fallback policy and health
- `/admin/program/fallback` - global fallback policy (silent video, plate rotation, or emergency slate)
- `/admin/operate` - live control-room hub for output, health, runbook and audit
- `/admin/calendar` - program days
- `/admin/schedule/[date]` - daily rundown
- `/admin/runbook/[date]` - preflight/live/incident/shutdown checklist
- `/admin/assets` - media library
- `/admin/vimeo` - Vimeo sync/import
- `/admin/guests` - guest records and individualized guest lineup plates
- `/admin/slides` - slide library
- `/admin/music` - background music assets
- `/admin/output` - live output control and overrides
- `/admin/health` - production readiness and Go Live Drill
- `/admin/audit` - operational audit trail
- `/manual` - public operator manual
- `/notion` - status and operating guide
- `/pending` - current roadmap and backlog
- `/output/live` - fullscreen browser playout
- `/output/preview/[blockId]` - fullscreen block preview
- `/api/health` - machine health check
- `/api/media/assets/[assetId]` - public media proxy for uploaded assets stored in local Supabase Storage

## Production Workflow

1. Open `/admin/prepare` and add or sync content: assets, Vimeo shows, music, guest plates, weather
   city plates and data plates.
2. Open `/admin/program` and build the day: calendar, schedule, timed loops, fallback policy and
   schedule health.
3. Configure **Fallback policy** at `/admin/program/fallback` before going active: silent video
   loop, plate rotation with background music, or emergency slate only.
4. Use **Fill range with plates** on `/admin/schedule/[date]` when the day needs a timed slide loop
   in the rundown. This is schedule-only and does not change the global fallback policy.
5. For normal video programs that are not live/Reuters/ads/promos, enable the optional
   `PREVIOUSLY RECORDED` bug from the block editor when editorial needs that disclosure.
6. Resolve schedule health issues and confirm fallback policy is **Ready** before activating the day.
   Unscheduled gaps show as **Protected** or **Unprotected** depending on fallback readiness.
7. Open `/admin/operate`, complete the runbook, open Output, launch Live Browser Output and click
   `Start Output` once to unlock audio.
8. Capture the live browser window in OBS/vMix.
9. During live, watch active block, next block, fallback reason, playlist/audio state, playback
   state and runbook notes from Operate/Output.
10. Stop broadcast and complete shutdown checks.

If the output page reloads mid-show, it asks the server for the active block and resumes video at the current scheduled offset. Browser audio still requires one operator click after load or reload.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Default local URL:

```txt
http://localhost:3450
```

Required `.env` values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=
OUTPUT_CAPTURE_TOKEN=
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=
ALERT_WEBHOOK_COOLDOWN_MS=600000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL=
APP_BASE_URL=
VIMEO_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

Optional external data inputs:

```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY= # optional; weather falls back to Open-Meteo when unset
ROXOM_METALS_API_URL=https://api.roxom.tv/api/metals # optional override
```

Production currently uses local Supabase for database/storage. Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
pointed at the local Supabase service, and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` or `APP_BASE_URL` to the
public app origin, for example `https://rtvtime.diegodella.ar`. Uploaded ads/promos are stored in
Supabase but played through the public app proxy at `/api/media/assets/[assetId]`.

Generate an encryption key:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test -- --run
npm run build
npm run smoke:http
npm run smoke:prod
bash scripts/deploy_local_tunnel.sh
npm run cf:build
npm run cf:deploy
```

Active production deploy for `rtvtime.diegodella.ar`:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_local_tunnel.sh
```

The active production path is local systemd service plus Cloudflare tunnel.

Alternate Cloudflare Workers/OpenNext path:

```bash
npm run cf:build
npm run cf:deploy
```

Cloudflare deploys must keep dashboard vars/secrets configured for Supabase, `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, `OUTPUT_CAPTURE_TOKEN`, app base URLs and any provider tokens such as Vimeo or Reuters. The scripts use `--keep-vars` so dashboard variables are preserved.

## Database

Normal migrations live in:

```txt
supabase/migrations/
```

Fresh Supabase bootstrap SQL for migration/offline setup:

```txt
public/manual/supabase-bootstrap.sql
```

Standalone guest lineup migration for existing backends:

```txt
supabase/migrations/20260522120000_guest_lineup.sql
supabase/migrations/20260522172000_slide_asset_metadata.sql
public/manual/guest-lineup-migration.sql
public/manual/slide-asset-metadata-migration.sql
```

Standalone rate-limit hardening migration for existing backends:

```txt
supabase/migrations/20260522153000_atomic_rate_limits.sql
public/manual/atomic-rate-limits-migration.sql
```

Events/calendar slide migration:

```txt
supabase/migrations/20260525181000_events_calendar.sql
public/manual/supabase-bootstrap.sql
```

Seed data:

```txt
supabase/seed.sql
```

Regenerate Supabase types:

```bash
npm run supabase:types
```

Backfill uploaded assets that were saved with local `127.0.0.1` storage URLs:

```bash
node scripts/backfill_public_storage_urls.mjs
node scripts/backfill_public_storage_urls.mjs --apply
```

The dry run prints candidate rows. `--apply` rewrites rows with `storage_bucket` and `storage_path`
to the public app proxy URL.

## Production Gates

Before live use:

- `/api/health` has no failing checks.
- the latest Supabase migrations are applied, including guest lineup and atomic rate limits.
- `/admin/health` Go Live Drill passes.
- current day exists and is `active`.
- active block has ready media or a ready fallback policy.
- uploaded media URLs use `https://rtvtime.diegodella.ar/api/media/assets/...`, not `127.0.0.1`.
- `/output/live?debug=true` plays on the capture browser after `Start Output`.
- OBS/vMix browser capture has been validated for video/audio; recheck after deploy or capture-machine changes.
- operator confirms fallback policy, runbook and shutdown process.

## Roadmap

Near-term priorities:

- remodel the visual design of on-air plates, cards and output surfaces
- improve operator alerts for drift, stalled playback, silence and media errors
- replace public health detail with admin-only diagnostics in any external status dashboard
- expand schedule copy/recurring-day tools after the live workflow is stable
